# Robot Attack!

This program was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio with OpenGL.

The main program is the game.cpp program, additional files required for the program to run are 
- vertexShader.vert (vertex shader), 
- fragmentShader.frag (fragment shader),
- cannonMesh.txt (mesh for cannon),
- tiles.bmp (texture),
- clover.bmp (texture), and
- stb_image.h (for texture loading).

All of the above files MUST be in the same directory for the program to compile and run properly.

Notes:
- Defensive cannon is mouse controlled (note: the cursor must be over the game window for mouse control to work, if the cursor goes outside, it must be brought back inside the window).
- Defensive cannon is a custom mesh generated by my other project OpenGL-Mesh.
- "SPACEBAR" key used to shoot Shrink Ray from the cannon.
- 3 Robots walk forward, and shoot randomly (accuracy should be about 10%).
- Defensive cannon has 3 HP, each hit will reduce it by 1 (displayed in terminal).
- When cannon HP is 0 or robots get past it, it is a loss and the cannon movement controls will disable and it will animate downwards.
- Custom lighting and shading via Vertex Shader and Fragment Shader(vertexShader.vert and fragmentShader.frag).
- Everything is texture mapped (defensive cannon, all parts of robot, projectiles, laser, floor, stars in background, etc.).
- 'q', 'Q', and 'Esc' exit the program.
- 'r' and 'R' restart the game.
